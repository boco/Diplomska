#Neck Veins

Software was primarily developed for visualization of 3D medical data in form of OBJ files, but can be also used for visualization of other 3D models in same format as well.

Software is developed in Java using OpenGL (via [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/)). Software also uses opensource library for GUI ([TWL](http://l33tlabs.org/)).


##Repository
This repository holds the Eclipse project of application. Just import the project into your workspace and update the links to native libraries for LWJGL (check LWJGL web-site for details).


##Credits
Application was originally developed as part of BSc Thesis of a student Simon Žagar in 2012 at Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. His thesis "Visualisation of neck veins with OpenGL", can be obtained [here](http://eprints.fri.uni-lj.si/1849/) (in slovene language).

Since then several other students extendex different parts of application:
* Anže Sodja 
* Peter Škrlj

DISCLAMER: I tried my best to respect the licenses of the libraries I used.
The compiled program may freeze if you use it to load an .obj file that is too big and use subdivision surface.
